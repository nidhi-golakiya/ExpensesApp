Resume Bullet Points for Expense Tracker Project:
Developed a FastAPI-based expense tracker with user authentication and CRUD operations using PostgreSQL as the backend database.

Containerized the application using Docker and managed environment configurations securely with environment variables.

Deployed the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using a custom Dockerfile, and connected it to an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance.

Set up continuous deployment via GitHub Actions, enabling automatic redeployment on push to the main branch.

Monitored deployment logs, configured health checks, and optimized EC2 instance types to stay within AWS Free Tier.

Implemented secure access to secrets using GitHub Actions secrets and AWS IAM best practices.
